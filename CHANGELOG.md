- Workaround an issue with the Ruby autoload that causes "uninitialized constant `Aws::Client::Errors`" errors.

## 1.1.0
- Logstash 5 compatibility

## 1.0.3
- added some metadata to the event (bucket and object name as commited by joshuaspence)
- also try to unzip files ending with ".gz" (ALB logs are zipped but not marked with proper Content-Encoding)

## 1.0.2
- fix for broken UTF-8 (so we won't lose a whole s3 log file because of a single invalid line, ruby's split will die on those)
